    "1. each instance of easure_circ_builder is now initialized with number of 2-qubit depolarization errors and the number of erasure errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. just like how I used the measurement record which include erasure flags to dynamically control the behavior of Error_mechanism. I can use a pre-computed bit array to control Error_mechanism for the purpose of importance sampling. That is, I add another mode to Error_mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. future plans\n",
    "\n",
    "1. once importance sampling is implements, then the same code can be used for simulating imperfect erasure detection and that doesn't require using a TableauSimulator. Basically, I row dices before running the simulator and use the dice results to generate a circuit with error probabilities being 1. running that circuit gives me measurement results. Based on the dice results I generate a decoding circuit with posterior probabilities and convert that to MWPM matching graph. Or I feed the erasure detection results and measurement results to a ML model."
