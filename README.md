# surface_erasure_decoding
Simulate and decoder surface code with erasure (assuming perfect erasure convertion) [Stim](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim)'s c++ code

# Direct Monte-Carlo usage:
1. use Docker to build a container and store in DockerHub.
2. generate decoding problem instances and send those instances to distributed computing
3. gather those decoding results in form of JSON files
4. data analytics on my local computer

# Importance sampling usage:
1. TODO:
